        A String is also a data type, only it is not primitive.
        This data type refers to an object, a sequence of char so to speak.
        Therefore it is a non-primitive data type.
        Primitive data types a static, a non-primitive data type is not and can
        be valued differently.
        Strings have to be surrounded by "double quotes", unlike char data types
        that have to be surrounded by 'single quotes'.

        Strings can also be named as Object reference data types.
