        Non-Primitive data types are called reference datatypes.
        They refer to a specific data types.

        The main differences between primitive and non-primitive data types are:
        - Primitive data types are predifined and built into the language, while
        non-primitive types are created by the programmer (except for String).
        - Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain
        operations, whereas primitive types cannot do this.
        - Primitive types start with a lowercase letter (int, double, boolean),
        while non-primitive types typically start with Uppercase (String).
        Primitive types always hold a value (even 0 is a value for an int),
        while non-prim can be a null value.

        Examples of non-primitive are Strings, Arrays, Classes.
